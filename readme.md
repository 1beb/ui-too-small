# UI Too Small 

Simple plugin to increase the size of the text in brackets for those of us using high def on linux.

## Configuration

You can make your own adjustments by editing main.js in your user extension folder.

In Brackets, click: Help > Show Extensions Folder > Navigate to user > Navigate to ui too small > open main.js, review css and edit as you need to. Save and push F5 to reload the brackets window to test your adjustments.

You can edit to your hearts content. We recommend changing the folder name so you avoid having your changes overwritten with future updates to the extension.
